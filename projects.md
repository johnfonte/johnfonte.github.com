## True Full-Stack development for the sole developer

I've developed a tech stack viable for quick setup of informational websites. I work with clients to ensure their exact vision is created, for a fraction of the cost. I'm interested in helping freelance developers create a viable plan for long-term business.

## Web Design Projects

### [SetMine](http://setmine.com)

Currently my biggest project, SetMine is a music streaming service available on all platforms. We're breaking ground in a new corner of digital music content delivery. I work on the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.setmine.android) app and Node.js server.

### [M-Fly](http://umich.edu/~mfly)

My most recent sole developer project, M-Fly is an SAE Aero Design team from the University of Michigan. Their website got a complete overhaul, and uses only HTML, CSS, and JQuery.

### [Sustainability International](http://sustainabilityinternational.org)

I designed this to focus on the beauty of nature in photos.Sustainability International encourages sustainable living practices in housing complexes.

### [Golf BMP Solutions](http://golfbmpsolutions.com)

An informational site for Golf BMP Solutions, a business based in Florida which aids golf courses in following federal regulations. I created this using Node.js and Twitter Bootstrap.

### [BetterAuth](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/pennapps-spring-2013/hacks/betterauth)

A hack created for PennApps Spring 2013. It saves time for anyone using Two-Factor Authentication by speeding up the authentication process. Normal Two-Factor Authentication displays tokens on the mobile device which are entered by hand after the username and password. Our Two-Factor solution decreases user input by sending this token to your browser for automatic entry.

### [Virulent Keyboard](https://github.com/johnfonte/virulent)

A personal project to create a custom keyboard, PCB and firmware. The keyboard has a custom layout where the number pad is switched to the left-hand side. I'm working on an updated version which will have a volume control knob, bluetooth/battery, and a metal plate/wooden case.
