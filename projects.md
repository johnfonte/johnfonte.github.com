## True Full-Stack development for the sole developer

I've developed a tech stack viable for quick setup of informational websites. I work with clients to ensure their exact vision is created, for a fraction of the cost. I'm interested in helping freelance developers create a viable plan for long-term business.

## Web Design Projects

### [SetMine](http://setmine.com)

Currently my biggest project, SetMine is a music streaming service available on all platforms. We're breaking ground in a new corner of digital music content delivery. I work on the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.setmine.android) app and Node.js server.

### [M-Fly](http://umich.edu/~mfly)

My most recent sole developer project, M-Fly is an SAE Aero Design team from the University of Michigan. Their website got a complete overhaul, and uses only HTML, CSS, and JQuery.
