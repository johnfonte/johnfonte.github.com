## Welcome

Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read my simple blog. I hope to discover a great deal about myself here, and I'd like your help.

I believe three simple things lead to success - Inspiration, Passion, and Consistency.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this blog comes from my sudden spike in focused motivation. In the past, I had a narrow worldview, focused on only the current day or maybe the next day. Now, I plan weeks in advance. I have a set of goals that I want to reach by the end of this year, and most importantly I have a plan to achieve them.

One of these goals is to find my niche in the professional world. To do this, I will write two posts each week - one serious, and the other lighthearted. Eventually, I'll find what I love to do, and turn that into what I can do for a living.

## Passion

The next thing I've been discovering is my passion for what I do. I'm passionate about my work in software development, which in the past has manifested itself in unhealthy spurts of long work periods followed by burnout.

Now, I have goals that are more clear and actionable. I found that a general goal was not as useful as a specific target. Yes, specific targets are scary, but I'll never "Gain algorithms proficiency"! Something more achievable is "Read 5 books about programming", which is on my goals list for this year. My dedication is now concentrated instead of scattered, which makes it more powerful.

## Consistency

I have to give credit to [John Sonmez](http://simpleprogrammer.com), whose article [My Secret to Ridiculous Productivity](http://simpleprogrammer.com/2014/02/17/secret-ridiculous-productivity-im-using-now/) helped me to realize that planning is the key to success. I don't use the [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/get-started/) yet, but I have found his advice valuable in relieving stress and accomplishing tasks.

Since reading that article, I've seen the largest increase in my productivity and focus ever. When I took notes in the past, they were more of a memory flush than an organizational tool. I've replaced note-taking with [Trello](https://trello.com), which helps me organize my work, goals, and next steps. This system leads to consistent and focused activity every day.

##  Thank You

As I move towards my new goals, I'll be documenting my story here. Thank you for reading, and I hope you find something useful.

There are a few others I'd like to thank, including [Dave Snider](http://www.davesnider.org/) and [Jonathan Stark](http://jonathanstark.com). Some simple elements from their blogs have made their way onto mine.
