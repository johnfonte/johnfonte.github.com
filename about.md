Hi! My name is John Fonte, and I'm a [software engineer](https://linkedin.com/pub/{{site.author.linkedin}}) based in Ann Arbor, MI.

I'm working on [SetMine](http://setmine.com), and in the past I built [M-Fly](http://umich.edu/~mfly), [Sustainability International](http://sustainabilityinternational.org), [Golf BMP Solutions](http://golfbmpsolutions.com), and a hack called [BetterAuth](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/pennapps-spring-2013/hacks/betterauth). I tinker with [embedded systems](https://github.com/johnfonte/virulent).

Got a project, idea, problem, or question? Talk to me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}) or shoot me an [email](mailto:{{site.author.email}})!
