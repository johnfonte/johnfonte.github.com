Hi! My name is John Fonte, and I'm a Software Engineer based in Orlando, FL. I work at [accesso](http://accesso.com).

I also work on [Hybrid Performance Method](https://hybridperformancemethod.com). In the past I built [M-Fly](http://umich.edu/~mfly), [Sustainability International](http://sustainabilityinternational.org), [Golf BMP Solutions](http://golfbmpsolutions.com), and a hack called [BetterAuth](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/pennapps-spring-2013/hacks/betterauth). I tinker with embedded systems and built a custom keyboard - [Virulent](https://github.com/johnfonte/virulent).

Got a question? Send me an [email](mailto:{{site.author.email}}) or connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/pub/{{site.author.linkedin}}).
